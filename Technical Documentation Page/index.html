        <p>
            Popularized by the Olympics, gymnastics is typically associated with grace and agility.
            When people think about gymnastics, they think of the acrobatic skills gymnasts commonly perform such
            front flips, back flips, spins around bars, and dismounts. However, there's much more to gymnastics than
            people commonly see.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, while gymnastics is often associated with feminimity given that women's gymnastics
            is much more common, men's gymnastics does exist, and it has many distinct characteristics. For one,
            while women's gymnastics has 4 events: uneven bars, beam, floor, and vault, men's gymnastics has
            six: floor, high bar, still rings, parallel bars, pommel horse, and vault.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the coolest distinction (in my opinion) is the inclusion of static(non-moving) strength elements
            which
            are basically mechanically disadvantageous postions that you hold for time, typically with a 2-3 second hold
            requirement.

        </p>
        <p>
            For each event, there are certain groups of skills that must be performed for full points.
            In the case of still rings, for example, the five element groups are: Kip And Swing Elements (Including
            L-sits),
            Swing To Handstand, Swing To Handstand, Strength And Hold Elements, and Dismounts. Naturally, the static
            strength
            skills are done to fulfill the Strength and Hold Elements group.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strength skills don't appear in all the events, however. High bar, pommel horse, and parallel bars don't
            have an explicit strength skill requirement, though they do have dynamic skills that require a lot of
            strength
            such as presses to handstands. Only still rings and floor contain strength elements as an element group,
            though they
            may be sometimes performed in other events depending on the circumstances.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Rings_versus_Floor">
        <header class="maroon">Rings versus Floor</header>
        <p>
            While both still rings and floor has a strength skill requirement, there are differences in how they are
            ranked.
            Gymnastics skills are each given a letter rating indicating their difficult, where A is the easiest (which
            are still very difficult for most people).
            The harder the skill, the higher the rating. The current highest rating static strength hold is an E on the
            rings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Floor as a base of support is significantly more stable than the still rings, which can move practically
            anywhere.
            Therefore, strength skills tend to be rated higher on the still rings compared to on floor.
            For example, a planche is a B on floor and a C on the still rings because of the instability.
            However, the planche will be explained later.
        </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Pushing_Skills">
        <header class="maroon">Pushing Skills</header>
        <p>
            Mens gymnastics static strength skills can be categorized in one of two groups: pushing or pulling.
            The way that they are defined is typically the kind of muscles used.

        </p>
        <p>
            Think of pushing a door. What muscles are you using in that motion(discluding legs and abs)?
            Your hand is placed on the door, your arm is bent, and you want to push it forward.
            You move your arm forward as it unbends. To do this, your shoulder must rotate upwards (using your front
            deltoids).
            The arm unbending requires triceps. And the initiation of the overall movement comes from the chest
            (depending on how close your elbow is to your chest when pushing).
            Therefore, pushing skills (and upper body pushing movements) primarily use: front deltoids, chest, and
            triceps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of gymnastic pushing strength skills:
        </p>
        <ul class="basic-list">
            <li>Planche</li>
            <li>Iron Cross</li>
            <li>Maltese</li>
            <li>Inverted Cross</li>
            <li>Presses to Handstand</li>
            <li>Back Lever</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are many other skills as well. Higher difficulty strength skills tend to be dynamic, moving between
            different static elements,
            which requires mastery over the positions you move through. For example, iron cross must be mastered before
            doing an iron cross press
            or a v-cross because these skills are essentially the iron cross with additional components.
        </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Pulling_Skills">
        <header class="maroon">Pulling Skills</header>
        <p>
            Now, let's talk about pulling skills. Think about pulling a door. Let's say that your arms are extended, and
            your hand is latched onto
            the door handle.
            You start by bringing your elbows towards your body. To do this, you use your upper back(but primarily your
            lats).
            You also bend your arm to bring the door closer. To actively bend your arms requires the bicep.
            Therefore, the main muscles worked in pulling skills (and upper body pulling movements) are the back and
            biceps.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of men's gymnastics, pulling skills are not possible on floor as there is nothing to grab onto
            (unless you plan to somehow pull the floor to you).
            Therefore, while both still rings and floor has pushing skills, only the still rings has pulling skills.
            As a side note, pulling skills don't suffer from nearly as much instability on the still rings in comparison
            to pushing skills.
            To visualize why, simply imagine a stick. Grabbing it and letting it hang, the stick easily finds its center
            of balance and remains.
            If you open your palm and try to balance the stick upright, however, suddenly the task is much more
            difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of gymnastic pulling strength skills:
        </p>
        <ul class="basic-list">
            <li>Front Lever</li>
            <li>Butterfly</li>
            <li>Victorian</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There aren't as many static pulling hold strength skills compared to pushing. However, they are equally
            common
            when it comes to dynamic skills.
            For example, in a Nakayama, you pull through the front lever, into the back lever, while opening up into an
            iron
            cross.

            The planche is a common calisthenics skill. As a result of the calisthenic popularity growth during
            quarantine,
            more people know about the planche than many other gymnastic skills.
            The planche is an advanced calisthenic and gymnastic skill, and there are several ways it can be performed.
            But first, what exactly is a planche?
        </p>

        <p>
            As you can see, the planche is a static hold where you hold your body horizontally above the ground by
            pushing away from it.
            Many people would be surprised to see how it's possible to simply hover above the ground like that.
            To explain what is happening in the planche as well as many other gymnastic/calisthenic static strength
            skills,
            first we will talk about center of mass.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is the center of mass of an object? It's essentially a point you can use as a reference that takes into
            account the
            weight distribution of the body. If you hold up a stick where mass is evenly distributed, the center of mass
            will be in the center.
            If the stick's mass has more mass on one side than the other, then the center of mass will shift towards
            that direction, meaning that
            the easiest position to hold the stick also moves accordingly, directly below the center of mass.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, let's think about a pushup. How does the body stay supported? Well, like we spoke about earlier, the
            center of mass must be supported somehow.
            In the case of a pushup, the hands make contact with the ground as well as the feet. While these are
            separate forces, the two are connected via the core.
            The core creates tension in the body that connects the forces from the hands and feet together to support
            the center of mass.
            One way to visualize this is to imagine holding a stick horizontally. This time, you aren't holding it from
            the center.
            Now, you are holding each end separately. The stick stays up. Why? Because of the stick's tension that
            connects the two opposite sides' forces.
            Now, if that stick had little to no tension, like if the stick was a piece of string, it would simply slump
            downward.
        </p>
        <p>
            With all that explanation, what does that have to do with the planche? Basically, the planche is a more
            forward version of a pushup hold.
            Let's say you are at the top of a pushup position. Your hands and feet support your body, connected by your
            core.
            As you lean forward, your hands drift closer to your waistline, which is where humans' center of mass
            typically is in a horizontal position.
            As this happens, your shoulders hold up more of the weight compared to your feet until... poof! You're
            hovering above the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            That said, it's not quite that simple because of one more thing: torque. While the body stays up because the
            center of mass is supported,
            there are now additional considerations. When in a typical pushup position, the arms and feet are a distance
            away from the center of mass.
            Let's say there there were only arms in that pushup position. What would happen? The legs would simply fall
            down. That's because of torque.
            As the distance from the center of mass increases, there is multiplicatively more force required to hold the
            object up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think holding a stick at the center of mass compared to at one of the ends. Suddenly, there is a lot of
            turning force working against you.
            The same applies to the planche. If you are in a pushup position and continue to lean forward, there is more
            force being transferred
            from the feet to the shoulder. However, the moment your hands are directly at your center of mass or
            waistline, there is an exponential
            increase in the amount of force required to push you up. This is because of the sudden inclusion of torque
            created from the body.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a full planche position where your legs are extended straight, the center of mass at your waistline
            creates a torque counter clockwise (in the picture)
            such that the shoulder has to create a clockwise torque to counter it. The entire point of this long
            explanation is to justify the
            progressions that will now be explained.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to learn planche and all other static strength skills, progressions must incrementally increase in
            difficulty.
            For the planche, this means:

        <p>
            As you can see, after the body is lifted from the ground, the progressions increase in difficulty depending
            on the
            degree of leg extension which influences the torque of the hold, with full planche requiring the most torque
            to counter the gravity of the lower body.
