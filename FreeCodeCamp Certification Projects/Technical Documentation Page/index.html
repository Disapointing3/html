        <p>
            Popularized by the Olympics, gymnastics is typically associated with grace and agility.
            When people think about gymnastics, they think of the acrobatic skills gymnasts commonly perform such
            front flips, back flips, spins around bars, and dismounts. However, there's much more to gymnastics than
            people commonly see.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, while gymnastics is often associated with feminimity given that women's gymnastics
            is much more common, men's gymnastics does exist, and it has many distinct characteristics. For one,
            while women's gymnastics has 4 events: uneven bars, beam, floor, and vault, men's gymnastics has
            six: floor, high bar, still rings, parallel bars, pommel horse, and vault.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the coolest distinction (in my opinion) is the inclusion of static(non-moving) strength elements
            which
            are basically mechanically disadvantageous postions that you hold for time, typically with a 2-3 second hold
            requirement.

        </p>
        <p>
            For each event, there are certain groups of skills that must be performed for full points.
            In the case of still rings, for example, the five element groups are: Kip And Swing Elements (Including
            L-sits),
            Swing To Handstand, Swing To Handstand, Strength And Hold Elements, and Dismounts. Naturally, the static
            strength
            skills are done to fulfill the Strength and Hold Elements group.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strength skills don't appear in all the events, however. High bar, pommel horse, and parallel bars don't
            have an explicit strength skill requirement, though they do have dynamic skills that require a lot of
            strength
            such as presses to handstands. Only still rings and floor contain strength elements as an element group,
            though they
            may be sometimes performed in other events depending on the circumstances.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Rings_versus_Floor">
        <header class="maroon">Rings versus Floor</header>
        <p>
            While both still rings and floor has a strength skill requirement, there are differences in how they are
            ranked.
            Gymnastics skills are each given a letter rating indicating their difficult, where A is the easiest (which
            are still very difficult for most people).
            The harder the skill, the higher the rating. The current highest rating static strength hold is an E on the
            rings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Floor as a base of support is significantly more stable than the still rings, which can move practically
            anywhere.
            Therefore, strength skills tend to be rated higher on the still rings compared to on floor.
            For example, a planche is a B on floor and a C on the still rings because of the instability.
            However, the planche will be explained later.
        </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Pushing_Skills">
        <header class="maroon">Pushing Skills</header>
        <p>
            Mens gymnastics static strength skills can be categorized in one of two groups: pushing or pulling.
            The way that they are defined is typically the kind of muscles used.

        </p>
        <p>
            Think of pushing a door. What muscles are you using in that motion(discluding legs and abs)?
            Your hand is placed on the door, your arm is bent, and you want to push it forward.
            You move your arm forward as it unbends. To do this, your shoulder must rotate upwards (using your front
            deltoids).
            The arm unbending requires triceps. And the initiation of the overall movement comes from the chest
            (depending on how close your elbow is to your chest when pushing).
            Therefore, pushing skills (and upper body pushing movements) primarily use: front deltoids, chest, and
            triceps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of gymnastic pushing strength skills:
        </p>
        <ul class="basic-list">
            <li>Planche</li>
            <li>Iron Cross</li>
            <li>Maltese</li>
            <li>Inverted Cross</li>
            <li>Presses to Handstand</li>
            <li>Back Lever</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are many other skills as well. Higher difficulty strength skills tend to be dynamic, moving between
            different static elements,
            which requires mastery over the positions you move through. For example, iron cross must be mastered before
            doing an iron cross press
            or a v-cross because these skills are essentially the iron cross with additional components.
        </p>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Pulling_Skills">
        <header class="maroon">Pulling Skills</header>
        <p>
            Now, let's talk about pulling skills. Think about pulling a door. Let's say that your arms are extended, and
            your hand is latched onto
            the door handle.
            You start by bringing your elbows towards your body. To do this, you use your upper back(but primarily your
            lats).
            You also bend your arm to bring the door closer. To actively bend your arms requires the bicep.
            Therefore, the main muscles worked in pulling skills (and upper body pulling movements) are the back and
            biceps.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of men's gymnastics, pulling skills are not possible on floor as there is nothing to grab onto
            (unless you plan to somehow pull the floor to you).
            Therefore, while both still rings and floor has pushing skills, only the still rings has pulling skills.
            As a side note, pulling skills don't suffer from nearly as much instability on the still rings in comparison
            to pushing skills.
            To visualize why, simply imagine a stick. Grabbing it and letting it hang, the stick easily finds its center
            of balance and remains.
            If you open your palm and try to balance the stick upright, however, suddenly the task is much more
            difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of gymnastic pulling strength skills:
        </p>
        <ul class="basic-list">
            <li>Front Lever</li>
            <li>Butterfly</li>
            <li>Victorian</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There aren't as many static pulling hold strength skills compared to pushing. However, they are equally
            common
            when it comes to dynamic skills.
            For example, in a Nakayama, you pull through the front lever, into the back lever, while opening up into an
            iron
            cross.

            The planche is a common calisthenics skill. As a result of the calisthenic popularity growth during
            quarantine,
            more people know about the planche than many other gymnastic skills.
            The planche is an advanced calisthenic and gymnastic skill, and there are several ways it can be performed.
            But first, what exactly is a planche?
        </p>

        <p>
            As you can see, the planche is a static hold where you hold your body horizontally above the ground by
            pushing away from it.
            Many people would be surprised to see how it's possible to simply hover above the ground like that.
            To explain what is happening in the planche as well as many other gymnastic/calisthenic static strength
            skills,
            first we will talk about center of mass.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is the center of mass of an object? It's essentially a point you can use as a reference that takes into
            account the
            weight distribution of the body. If you hold up a stick where mass is evenly distributed, the center of mass
            will be in the center.
            If the stick's mass has more mass on one side than the other, then the center of mass will shift towards
            that direction, meaning that
            the easiest position to hold the stick also moves accordingly, directly below the center of mass.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, let's think about a pushup. How does the body stay supported? Well, like we spoke about earlier, the
            center of mass must be supported somehow.
            In the case of a pushup, the hands make contact with the ground as well as the feet. While these are
            separate forces, the two are connected via the core.
            The core creates tension in the body that connects the forces from the hands and feet together to support
            the center of mass.
            One way to visualize this is to imagine holding a stick horizontally. This time, you aren't holding it from
            the center.
            Now, you are holding each end separately. The stick stays up. Why? Because of the stick's tension that
            connects the two opposite sides' forces.
            Now, if that stick had little to no tension, like if the stick was a piece of string, it would simply slump
            downward.
        </p>
        <p>
            With all that explanation, what does that have to do with the planche? Basically, the planche is a more
            forward version of a pushup hold.
            Let's say you are at the top of a pushup position. Your hands and feet support your body, connected by your
            core.
            As you lean forward, your hands drift closer to your waistline, which is where humans' center of mass
            typically is in a horizontal position.
            As this happens, your shoulders hold up more of the weight compared to your feet until... poof! You're
            hovering above the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            That said, it's not quite that simple because of one more thing: torque. While the body stays up because the
            center of mass is supported,
            there are now additional considerations. When in a typical pushup position, the arms and feet are a distance
            away from the center of mass.
            Let's say there there were only arms in that pushup position. What would happen? The legs would simply fall
            down. That's because of torque.
            As the distance from the center of mass increases, there is multiplicatively more force required to hold the
            object up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think holding a stick at the center of mass compared to at one of the ends. Suddenly, there is a lot of
            turning force working against you.
            The same applies to the planche. If you are in a pushup position and continue to lean forward, there is more
            force being transferred
            from the feet to the shoulder. However, the moment your hands are directly at your center of mass or
            waistline, there is an exponential
            increase in the amount of force required to push you up. This is because of the sudden inclusion of torque
            created from the body.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a full planche position where your legs are extended straight, the center of mass at your waistline
            creates a torque counter clockwise (in the picture)
            such that the shoulder has to create a clockwise torque to counter it. The entire point of this long
            explanation is to justify the
            progressions that will now be explained.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to learn planche and all other static strength skills, progressions must incrementally increase in
            difficulty.
            For the planche, this means:

        <p>
            As you can see, after the body is lifted from the ground, the progressions increase in difficulty depending
            on the
            degree of leg extension which influences the torque of the hold, with full planche requiring the most torque
            to counter the gravity of the lower body. Generally, at least a perfect 8 second hold of the previous
            progression is required
            to move onto the next one, though there are many nuances at hand here.
        </p>
        <p>
            The full planche is given a B rating on floor and C on rings in the Gymnastics Code of Points (CoP).
            As a side note, the straddle planche is also considered a skill in men's gymnastics, though it's always
            rated one point less.
            On floor, the straddle planche is an A and a B on rings.
        </p>
        <p>Static skills are also often done dynamically to increase the difficulty. In calisthenics, people

            often do planche pushups to progressively overload load difficulty for muscle hypertrophy, or to just show
            off.
            In gymnastics, planche pushups are not considered a skill, as strength skills are generally performed with
            straight arms.

            However, straight arm dynamics using static skills can significantly increase the difficulty of a skill.
            For example, the planche press to handstand increases the difficulty of a typical planche by one letter
            rating in CoP.
            A straddle planche press to handstand on rings is a C, and a full planche press to handstand is a D.
            A planche is also often used in very advanced movements such as the Van Gelder which is essentially a
            planche drop down to back lever, back up to planche with straight arms.
            A Van Gelder is given an E on rings.

        <p>Now, with all of that theory out of the way, exercises become easier to explain.
            The front lever can be thought of as the opposite of the planche, at least in terms of opposing muscle
            groups (not in difficulty).
            As is visible in the above image, the front lever is characterized by horizontal straight body position from
            pulling.
            Instead of using the shoulders like in the planche, the front lever primarily relies upon the lats.
        </p>
        <p>
            The difficulty in holding this position once again comes from the torque created by the straight body
            position moving the center
            of mass away from the lats.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like in the planche, progressions to increase difficulty depends on the extension of the legs, though
            it's important to be good at pullups and have strong lats beforehand.
            The progressions are as follows:

            The front lever is rated as A in CoP, but like with planche, it can be used dynamically as well.
            For example, in an Azarian (D), a person pulls through a front lever with straight arms, through the back
            into a partial back lever, before opening up to an iron cross.
            There are even harder skills such as the Yan Mijayoung (E) which is a front lever to maltese to planche.
        </p>
        <p>
            The planche is considerably easier than the planche for several reasons. First, the lats tend to be stronger
            than the front deltoid for most people.
            Think about how people can normally do pullups, which uses their full bodyweight. However, people would
            struggle doing a pushup with their full bodyweight in comparison (though a planche would be harder than
            that).
            Additionally, the stability of the rings tends to make planche more difficult. However, for pulling skills
            like the front lever,
            that's rarely as much of an issue.

            The back lever is similar to a front lever in that it is below the bar. However, don't be fooled. This
            exercise is actually
            a pushing skill. This is because the primary muscle used here is the front deltoid. Rather than thinking of
            it akin to a front lever,
            it's more accurate to think of it as a planche except that the arms are further up behind you. The motion
            the force has to exert is the same,
            so it relies on the same muscle as the planche. However, now the front delt is simply in a further extended
            position.
        </p>
        <p>
            That said, the back lever is still significantly easier than the planche. It's given an A in CoP. This is
            because you can
            engage more muscles than in a planche to assist you. While the scapula must be protracted in a planche
            (fully extended in front of you),
            you can retract (pull behind you) the scapula in a back lever, which will help lock the position in place.
            Additionally,
            because of the positioning of the arms and the scapula position, you can use your chest to further assist
            you, making it relatively easy to learn.

            The progressions have to do with expanding the torque as usual:

        Generally, people first starting out with calisthenics will choose the back lever as their first major
        milestone,
        as it is much easier than the front lever and planche. The back lever builds front deltoid and elbow tendon
        strength
        which will have some carryover to the planche and other difficult skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        As with the other skills mentioned above, the back lever can be used in combination with other skills to become
        more difficult.
        For example, the Van Gelder (E) is a planche, drop to back lever, then bounce back up to planche. The Nakayama
        (D) is a back lever to cross.

            The iron cross is an iconic skill in men's gymnastics. It's one of the most well known strength skills in
            gymnastics as a whole, and for a good reason.
            It's a skill that displays dominance over the rings as you hold yourself up in an iron cross. However,
            despite its popularity, it is by no means the hardest skill.
            It's rated as a B in CoP, which makes it a rank higher than front and back lever, while being one below the
            full planche on rings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The iron cross is still a difficult move for most people. The iron cross can be classified as either a
            pushing or a pulling skill depending on the way you hold it.
            The iron cross can be held with varying degrees of internal or external rotation of the shoulders which
            changes the muscles being used.
            If the shoulders are externally rotated (elbow pit facing up), the force is being generated by pulling your
            arms down, hence the
            back.
            However, if the shoulders are internally roated (elbow pit facing down), the force is being generated by
            pushing your arms down,
            which uses the chest.
            What position someone decides to use depends on their strengths, whether their chest or shoulders are
            stronger; they could also go in between, using both sides.
            However, most people find internal rotation to be the easier position to hold as it also lets you "lock in"
            the shoulder joint to assist you in the hold, though that will only help in a specific range of motion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The progressions recommendations are a bit different than the other ones as there is no longer a torque
            issue coming from the extension of the legs, but simply the length of the arms.
            Here's one way of progressing:

            As you can see, because the torque no longer comes from leg extension, the general method of progressing in
            this skill has to do with
            slowly increasing the arm's distance from the force point. You start with holding yourself up comfortably in
            the ring support hold before starting to do iron cross with decreased difficult.
            There are several methods at changing lever length, but the iron cross trainers are an easy way to do so.
            The contraption simply puts a wooden bar below your arm at whatever point you desire.
            If the bar is placed right after your elbow pit, that's essentially where the force is begin generated from,
            decreasing the torque. After using that method for a while, you can simply attempt the full skill with a
            spot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Iron cross is a skill that requires a lot of prior joint conditioning beforehand. Because of the position of
            the arms, the elbow takes
            a large part of the beating. Without proper conditioning, someone's arm could snap at the elbow pit,
            particularly with internal rotation.
            When the elbow pit faces down, the bicep must isometrically contract in a lengthened position to counteract
            the force trying to snap the arm.
            For that reason, it's important to have reasonable powerful biceps and elbow tendon before starting to train
            this skill.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the hold itself is not rated that high, there are many other skills the iron cross is used in. An iron
            cross press is a C.
            A Li Xiaoshuang is a C (kinda like a straight arm muscle up). A Pineda (front lever, back lever, iron cross)
            is a D. Pineda (front lever, cross) is a D.
            Cross to Inverted Cross is a D. There are so many other skills the iron cross is used for; that's the main
            reason why it's so popular.

            This list is not comprehensive in any sense and only goes over a few common skills that branch out into many
            others in gymnastics and calisthenics.
            Skills were categorized into pushing and pulling, but there are other kinds such as compression (like the
            manna).
            Many skills fall into multiple categories, and what really matters in the end is simply freedom in movement,
            to be able to control the body in space no matter the position's disadvantageous leverages.
